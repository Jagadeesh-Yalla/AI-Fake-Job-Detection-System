# AI-Based Fake Job Posting Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect fraudulent job postings. 
It helps protect job seekers from online recruitment scams.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Online job portals sometimes contain fake or fraudulent job postings. 
This project aims to build a classification model that can automatically detect fake job listings.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Model Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
2. Text Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
4. Train-Test Split
5. Logistic Regression Model Training
6. Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Classification Report & Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~94–96%
- Improved fraud detection using balanced classification
- Visualized results using confusion matrix

## 📊 Dataset
This project uses the *Real or Fake Job Posting Prediction* dataset from Kaggle.

🔗 Dataset Link:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction

The dataset contains job postings labeled as real or fake and is used to train and evaluate the classification model.
